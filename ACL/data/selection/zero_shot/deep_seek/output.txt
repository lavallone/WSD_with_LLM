senseval2.d001.s011.t006	The most suitable dictionary definition for "discovered" in the context of the sentence is:

**3) make a discovery, make a new finding**

This definition aligns with the idea that the family of genes (oncogenes) was newly identified or found during the early 1980s, which fits the scientific context of the sentence.
senseval2.d001.s011.t007	The most suitable dictionary definition for "early" in the sentence "The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes" is:

**1) at or near the beginning of a period of time or course of events or before the usual or expected time.**

This definition fits because "early 1980s" refers to the beginning part of that decade.
senseval2.d001.s011.t008	The most suitable dictionary definition for the word "called" in the sentence "The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes" is:

senseval2.d001.s012.t010	The most suitable dictionary definition for "suggesting" in the given sentence is:

**3) imply as a possibility**

The sentence implies that the presence of oncogenes in both normal and cancerous cells suggests (implies as a possibility) that oncogenes alone do not cause cancer. This aligns with the idea of hinting at or indicating a possibility rather than making a direct proposal or calling for intervention.
senseval2.d001.s012.t012	The most suitable dictionary definition for "cause" in the context of the sentence is:

**1) give rise to; cause to happen or occur, not always intentionally.**

senseval2.d001.s013.t001	The most suitable dictionary definition for "months" in the given sentence is:

**1) one of the twelve divisions of the calendar year**

This is because the sentence refers to a general period of time ("recent months") rather than specifying a precise duration of approximately 30 days. The context suggests a broader timeframe rather than a specific count of days.
senseval2.d001.s013.t003	The most suitable dictionary definition for "come" in the given sentence is:

**4) reach or enter a state, relation, condition, use, or position.**

**2) (biology) the basic structural and functional unit of all organisms; they may exist as independent units of life (as in monads) or may form colonies or tissues as in higher plants and animals.**

This definition aligns with the biological context of the sentence, which discusses cancer genes and the behavior of cells in relation to oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes.
senseval2.d001.s013.t015	The most suitable dictionary definition for "only" in the given sentence is:

**6) never except when**

This definition fits the context of the sentence, which implies that the oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant **only after** the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged. In other words, the oncogene's malignant effect occurs **never except when** the tumor-suppressor gene is damaged.
